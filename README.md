Insurance Cost Analysis & Prediction

This project explores the "insurance" dataset to understand the factors influencing insurance charges and preprocessing  the data for further machine learning model.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Data Loading & Inspection**:            Read the dataset using pandas and checked for missing/null values.
**Visualization**:                        Using subplots to visualize relationships between each features against "charges".
**Statistical Analysis**:                 compared mean charges across subcategories within each feature.
                                          Determined that "sex" and "region" have minimal impact on "charges" .

Data Preprocessing

**Outlier Removal**:                      Applied the standard deviation method to detect and remove outliers from numerical features.
**Feature Selection**:                    the "sex" and "region" has very less impact on "charges" ,hence its better to drop them.
**Categorical Encoding**:                 Converted "smoker" column: "yes" → 1, "no" → 0 .
**Final Dataset**:                        Cleaned and transformed dataset ready for machine learning tasks.
